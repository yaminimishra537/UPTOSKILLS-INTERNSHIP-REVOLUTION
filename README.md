🔧 Tasks Performed:
Filtered out nulls, blanks, and inconsistent entries across tables

Standardized formats (e.g., phone numbers, states, email domains)

Removed duplicate records and irrelevant data points

Joined and merged tables for consolidated analysis

Categorized and grouped records to enhance clarity

Ensured referential integrity between related datasets

🛠️ Tools Used:
MySQL – For querying, transforming, and cleaning raw data

Google Colab (Python) – For additional preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)

Power BI – For dashboard creation after data cleaning

📊 Outcomes:
Cleaned and integrated datasets used in building dashboards showing intern joining trends, domain interest by region, and outreach impact.

Enabled insightful diagnostics and strategic recommendations for enhancing engagement and outreach efforts.

🚀 About the Internship:
